# Improvemenets of our project between March 2nd and March 9th, 2018

* **Bar chart added** at the bottom right of the page, describing why do people use a station
* Notify the user when **data is missing** for the icons or the barchart
* Better placement of the icons, less hardcoding (before, the icons could go over their square)
* Round up the scale values on the radar chart (7.0 => 7)
* Add a **reset button to easily deselect the stations**
* For each station's feature (e.g. its number of travellers), show its **ranking among all the stations**
* Add **filters on the map**: to show only the stations that are equipped with wifi for instance
* When one or more filters are on, add a **reset button to turn off all the filters**
* Show a **total score** for the station's performance (shown on the radar chart)
* When the circles' radius & color legends are hovered, instead of the concerned circles on the map being highlighted, now, the not-concered circles disappear
* Change of the blue color (it was thought too dark)
* Translation into English
